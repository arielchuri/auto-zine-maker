<h2 id="autozinefier">AutoZinefier</h2>
<p>This zine was typed in a <em>plain text editor</em> using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">markdown</a> and html. 
You can see some of the text I typed below.  This is what I typed to create the beginning of the following chapter.</p>
<pre>
&lt;section markdown="1"&gt;

## Ranger

You are gristled loner raised by bears, a storied hunter and tracker, a camoflouged predator shooting from the bush. 
Rangers are warriors of the forest. What they lack in hit points, they make up for in luck and skill.

**Hit points:** A ranger gains 1d8 hit points at each level.

**Weapon training:** A ranger is trained in the use of these weapons: club, dagger, long sword, spear, staff, and all ranged weapons. 
</pre>
<p>I then use a script on my computer to transform this into a webpage and PDF.
The images are in a separate folder and, are linked in the text as well.</p>
<p>You can see all of the text by looking at the croak.md file at this link: <a href="https://github.com/arielchuri/autozinefier/">https://github.com/arielchuri/autozinefier/</a>.
The html and pdf files are in there as well.
Here is the html as a webpage: <a href="https://arielchuri.github.io/autozinefier/croak.html">https://arielchuri.github.io/autozinefier/croak.html</a>.</p>
<p>To do this at home, use the button that says, <em>code</em> to download a zip file of everything.
You will need to install two command line programs. Python-markdown (<a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">https://python-markdown.github.io/</a>) and Weasyprint (<a href="https://weasyprint.org/">https://weasyprint.org/</a>).</p>
<p>You can then run the included script called <em>markdowntopdf.sh</em>. On my computer, I type <kbd>sh ./markdowntopdf.sh croak</kbd> in the terminal. If that works, you can copy <em>croak.md</em> to a new file like <em>myfilename.md</em> with no spaces. Change the text and images and then use the command <kbd>sh ./markdowntopdf.sh myfilename</kbd> to make your own zine. All of my work here is released as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons 0</a> so you can do whatever you want with it.</p>

<h2 id="ranger">Ranger</h2>
<p>You are gristled loner raised by bears, a storied hunter and tracker, a camoflouged predator shooting from the bush. Rangers are warriors of the forest. What they lack in hit points, they make up for in luck and skill.</p>
<p><strong>Hit points:</strong> A ranger gains 1d8 hit points at each level.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon training:</strong> A ranger is trained in the use of these weapons: club, dagger, long sword, spear, staff, and all ranged weapons. Rangers may wear any armor.</p>
<p><strong>Attack modifier:</strong> The ranger has a deed die and <em>Mighty Deeds of Arms</em>, just as the warrior.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged attacks bonus:</strong> The ranger gains a +1d bonus to ranged attack rolls, and ranged attack damage.</p>
<p><strong>Critical hits:</strong> The ranger enjoys the same expanded crit range as warriors but only on ranged attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Aiming:</strong> Taking a round to aim a ranged attack adds +2 to the roll. A target that is unaware of any danger and struck by an aiming ranger, receives a critical hit as long as the attack is successful.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative:</strong> A ranger adds his class level to his initiative rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Luck:</strong> Rangers are naturall lucky. A ranger regenerates luck at the rate of 1 point each day.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger skills:</strong> Rangers roll a d24 on all hunting, nature, and survival checks. Rangers can track most quarry without a roll at all.</p>

<h2 id="barbarian"><strong>Barbarian</strong></h2>
<p>A Warrior with no mighty deed and a natural AC bonus that is modified by the Armor Check penalty. Berserker mode adds a random element and removes some player agency.  The barbarian’s, action dice, and fort save is slightly better than the warrior while the will save and attack bonus are decreased.</p>
<p><strong>Hit points:</strong> 1d12 hit points per level</p>
<p><strong>Weapon training:</strong> A barbarian is trained in the use of these weapons:
battleaxe, club, crossbow, dagger, handaxe, javelin, longsword, mace,
polearm, shortbow, short sword, sling, spear, staff, two-handed sword,
and warhammer. Barbarians may wear any armor but the armor&rsquo;s check
penalty offsets their natural, agility based, armor class bonus.</p>
<p>Notably absent from the weapons list is the longbow which would require
additional training to master.</p>
<p><strong>Armor class:</strong>  The barbarian gains an armor class bonus based on
their level. This bonus is reduced by any armor check penalty or any
other agility modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Attack</strong>: Berserker Die, same as Deed Die but no mighty deeds. Max
roll on the berserker die and the barbarian goes berserk. The player may
choose to roll any die lower on the dice chain (make the fight harder to
make yourself angrier and more likely to go berserk). The player may
burn a point of Intelligence to avoid entering Berserker Mode.</p>
<p><strong>Berserker</strong>: When facing a threat and rolling the maximum value on the
berserker die, the barbarian goes berserk until their are no reachable
enemies or they burns 2 points of intelligence. A berserk barbarian adds their Fort save to their armor class. The barbarian gains an additional
action die -1d on the dice chain from their highest action die.
This action may be used during the current round.</p>
<p>Going berserk imposes the following additional modifiers to saving
throws; +2 Fort, +2 Reflex, -2 Will.</p>
<p>It is not possible to enter berserk mode at will. In other words, the
roll that goes berserk must be against a real threat.</p>
<p>After a going berserk the barbarian freaks out.</p>
<p><strong>Freak Out (d6)</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attack closest anything once at -d1 attack and damage.</li>
<li>Destroy furniture sized object. As above if no object available.</li>
<li>Strip clothes and bathe in the blood of your enemies.</li>
<li>Run around screaming in people&rsquo;s faces.</li>
<li>Victory cry / dance</li>
<li>Flex</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>See Red:</strong> Burn personality to Increase attack, damage and crit rolls
for 1 round. Your armor class is reduced by the same amount.</p>

<h2 id="dark-elf"><strong>Dark Elf</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on who you ask, the Dark Elves are the corrupt, outcasts of the high elves or the true carriers of the Elven lineage. What they lack in martial prowess is made up for by their abilities as rogues and assassins. </p>
<p>Dark Elves can heal luck and use it to cast spells, but cannot spellburn except at great cost. Burning Stats other than luck causes permanent damage.</p>
<p><strong>Attack</strong> as Thief</p>
<p><strong>Action Dice</strong> as Thief</p>
<p><strong>Crit die/table</strong> as Elf</p>
<p><strong>Spells Known</strong> as Elf -2 and no automatic Patron Bond/Invoke Patron</p>
<p><strong>Thief Skills</strong> as Thief -1 except <em>Read From Scroll</em> as Elf</p>
<p><strong>Caster Level</strong> -1</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws</strong> as Thief</p>
<p><strong>Luck Die</strong> 1:1 at first level and then as Thief -d1 thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Spellburn</strong> Spellburn damage is permanent.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption</strong> -d1 (d8) when rolling for corruption or patron taint.
Luck burned to change rolls or avoid corruption is permanent.</p>
<p><strong>Heal Luck</strong> as Thief</p>
<p><strong>Thieves&rsquo;Cant </strong>No but does know a Dark Elf dialect of Elven that has a
DC 15 Int check chance of being understood by an Elf. Standard Elven is
the most likely third language known and DC 15 to understand if not.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerability</strong> Prolonged contact with iron causes 4hp damage per day
and -1d on all rolls. Damage from iron weapons causes an additional 1d3
points of damage.</p>

<h2 id="halfling-pipeweed">Halfling Pipeweed</h2>
<p>No self respecting halfling is without their pipe and some good pipeweed.
While smoking standard pipeweed has no mechanical effect, certain herbal additives maybe added to a hot pipe to enhance the halflings abilities.
A halfling may forage for pipeweed by rolling on the following table.
Typically just before their next adventure.</p>
<p>Standard pipeweed can only be foraged but may be bought in shops in areas where halflings reside for 10sp each.
It should also be noted that it would be terribly rude for a halfling to refuse another halfling a puff of pipeweed and nearly as rude for the favor to not be asked. </p>
<p>A halfling must use a portion of standard pipeweed to keep their pipe lit all day.
With their pipe lit the halfling may use an action to add a little herbal supplement to the pipe. Effects do not stack.</p>
<p class="forground"><img alt="" src="images/outro.svg" /></p>
<h3 class="breakbefore" id="pipeweed-foraging-table">Pipeweed Foraging Table</h3>
<p>A half day spent foraging may uncover some valuable pipeweed. Roll 3d16 +/-Luckmod.</p>

<p><strong>Disgust:</strong> Any human in a 5’ range must make a fort save each round or lose a round. Demihumans are immune. </p>
<p><strong>Swallow:</strong> If bite successful; DC 15 Strength check or be half swallowed.
The character will be upside down in the slurm&rsquo;s mouth with arms pinned at the waist and legs kicking.
On the Slurm’s next turn the character drops any large weapon and is completely swallowed (unless aided in some way).
Swallowed characters lose 1d3 Stamina per round and take half damage from piercing and bludgeoning attacks on the Slurm.
Chance of mutation. 10%/round, cumulative. Minor corruption table modified by luck.
Swallowed characters who have access to a blade must make DC 15 Strength check to attack. </p>
<p>Anyone reduced to 6 or less Stamina becomes a Slurm Symbiote and is ejected from the rear (100% chance of mutation). The worms grow in the body.
