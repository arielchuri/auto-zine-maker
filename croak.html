<h2 id="ranger-test">Ranger test</h2>
<p>You are gristled loner raised by bears, a storied hunter and tracker, a camoflouged predator shooting from the bush. Rangers are warriors of the forest. What they lack in hit points, they make up for in pure skill.</p>
<p><strong>Hit points:</strong> A ranger gains 1d8 hit points at each level.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon training:</strong> A ranger is trained in the use of these weapons: club, dagger, long sword, spear, staff, and all ranged weapons. Rangers may wear any armor.</p>
<p><strong>Attack modifier:</strong> The ranger has a deed die and <em>Mighty Deeds of Arms</em>, just as the warrior.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged attacks bonus:</strong> The ranger gains a +1d bonus to ranged attack rolls, and ranged attack damage.</p>
<p><strong>Critical hits:</strong> The ranger enjoys the same expanded crit range as warriors but only on ranged attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Aiming:</strong> Taking a round to aim a ranged attack adds +2 to the roll. A target that is unaware of any danger and struck by a hidden and aiming ranger, receives a critical hit as long as the attack is successful.</p>
<p><strong>Initiative:</strong> A ranger adds his class level to his initiative rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Luck:</strong> At first level, a warrior’s Luck modifier applies to attack rolls with one specific kind of weapon. This kind of weapon must be chosen at first level and the modifier is fixed at its starting value – neither the weapon nor the modifier changes over the course of the warrior’s career. The weapon type must be specific: longsword or short sword, not “swords.”</p>
<p><strong>Ranger skills:</strong>
Rangers roll a d24 on all hunting, nature, and survival checks. Rangers can track most quarryy without a roll at all.</p>

<h2 id="halfling-pipeweed">Halfling Pipeweed</h2>
<div class="colstwo">
<p>No self respecting halfling is without their pipe and some good pipweed.
A halfling may forage for pipeweed by rolling on the following table.
Typically just before their next adventure.</p>
<p>Standard pipeweed may be bought in shops in areas where halflings reside for 10sp each. It should also be noted that it would be terribly rude for a halfling to refuse another halfling a pinch of pipeweed and normal for the favor to be asked. </p>
<p>A halfling must use a portion of standard pipeweed to keep their pipe lit all day.
With their pipe lit the halfling may use an action to add a little herbal supplement to the pipe. Effects do not stack.</p>

<h2 id="slurm-priest">Slurm Priest</h2>
<p><strong>Slurm Priest:</strong> Init +2; Atk bite +2 melee (1d6 + swallow), Vomit Puss Goblin +3 ranged 40’ (1d3, 5’ area effect); AC 12; HD 2d8; hp 10; MV 20&rsquo;; Act 1d20 + 1d14; SP disgust, swallow, vomit, defecate; SV Fort +5, Ref +0, Will +0; AL C.</p>
<div class="colstwo">
<p>This upright, purple worm loves jewelry, profanity, and is always found with the Slime Goblins it has excreted. 
A supplicant of its chaos lord, the Slurm Priest is often called to test the forces of Law. </p>
<p><strong>Disgust:</strong> Any human in a 5’ range must make a fort save each turn or lose a turn. Demihumans are immune. </p>
<p><strong>Swallow:</strong> If bite successful; DC 15 Strength check or be half swallowed. The character will be upside down with arms pinned at waist and legs kicking. On the Slurm’s next turn the character drops any large weapon and is completely swallowed (unless aided in some way). Swallowed characters lose 1d3 Stamina per round and take half damage from piercing and bludgeoning attacks on the Slurm.  Swallowed characters who have access to a blade must make DC 15 Strength check to attack. </p>
<p>Characters who lose Stamina in the Slurm’s stomach have a chance of mutation (10% per point of Stamina, minor corruption table modified by luck).
The Slurm gains -1 attack and -5’ movement per person swallowed. </p>
<p>Anyone reduced to 6 or less Stamina becomes a Slurm Symbiote and is ejected from the rear (100% chance of mutation). The worms grow in the body. Over the next week, barring intervention, the victim falls very ill, begins to bloat, attempts to attack lawful clerics, and explodes releasing thousands of purple worms. </p>
</div>
<h3 id="vomit">Vomit</h3>
<p>Can shoot a Puss Goblin. Shooting it up to 40’. +3 ranged, 1d4 Dam. The Puss Goblin explodes on a hit or lands ready to attack next turn on a miss. </p>
<h3 id="defecate">Defecate</h3>
<p>Can release 3 Puss Goblins. If the Slurm has ingested Stamina, the Slurm can release Acid or Napalm Goblins. </p>
<h3 id="exiting">Exiting</h3>
<p>Upon losing a moral check or being reduced to too few HP; the Slurm will forcibly eject any characters in its stomach and bite its own tail and swallow itself until it has disappeared with a small pop. Upon death; the worm deflates with gas and fluid leaking out, leaving only a bit of skin, lips, teeth, and jewelry (1d14+14gp).
